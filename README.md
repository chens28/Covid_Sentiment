# Covid Sentiment Analysis

In this project, I used Python to explore the reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic on Twitter Between July 24th, 2020 and  August 30th, 2020 by performing an sentiment analysis on COVID-19 related tweets. Steps included preprocessing and tokenizing text data, labeling them with positive, negative, and neutral sentiments, and visualizing the results of the analysis. See the final Visualization below:
